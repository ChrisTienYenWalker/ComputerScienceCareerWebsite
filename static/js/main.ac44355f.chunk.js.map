At University, you can personalize your courses to the field you wish to enter. As well as learn new skills such as machine learning, which can let you create a prediction application. To get into these universities you need 6 grade 12 U/M classes, including advanced functions, calculus and vectors, any 4U English class, and one more university class. University is a great path if you plan to look at a board view of computer science. \",\r\n                \"If you decide to go through College to get into web development, you will go through the General Web Design and Development Program. This degree will give you the basic experience to become a web developer. You will not have as much theory on advanced logic of programming but you will gain more valuable skills to web development such as supporting and managing your website. The minimum requirement for entry is to finish high school with one grade 12 English class and one grade 12 math class; a grade 12 technology class would also be helpful. \",\r\n                \"If you decide to go learn through a bootcamp, you will be learning only about a certain subject(this case is web development). Boot Camps cost less with the web development course from lighthouse lab costing $11, 500. Here you will learn everything that you need to know to become an entry level full stack developer. It will give you an opportunity to learn from others who have specialized in the field as well as meet others going down the same career path as you. Lighthouse labs bootcamp has a great program for a reasonable cost.\",\r\n                \"\tWaterloo is one of Canada’s top universities for technology and offers a wide variety of courses and experiences. To get into Waterloo the admission average is low 90s from your 6 grade 12 U/M classes, including advanced functions, calculus, and vectors, any 4U English class, one more university class, and it is suggested that you take grade 11 computer science. This program takes 4 years, but if you join the co-op program, it takes 5 years. I would suggest doing co-op because Waterloo has great locations for co-op such as Microsoft, this gives you the most important education, practice. During your first year at Waterloo, you will take Designing Functional Programs, Algorithm Design, and Data Abstraction,  Algebra,  Calculus 1, Linear Algebra 1, Calculus 2, a Communication course and three electives. These electives can be anything you want, but I suggest at least one of them, either introduction to Computing through Applications(learning the internet) or Introduction to Computer Programming 1 (learn the fundamentals of programming). Waterloo will give you the information necessary to enter the web development field, but if you join the co-op, they will give you the experience you need to succeed in the field.

Tech impact on the world is crazy.\r\n                    <br></br>                    <br></br>\r\n\r\n                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a high school student, I see technology everywhere. From classrooms to the economy, it is around us and now binds the modern times. School brings an inspecting view on technology l, a negative one. The economy is heavily impacted by technology. Companies like Kinaxis allow other sectors to view their future supply chains which means that tech does not only have an impact on its own economy. As technology rules the modern day we see major tech giants gaining too much power. During the last American election, Donald Trump used Twitter to get attention. Yes, the tech industry has a huge impact on the economy but also in other sectors. Last year Doug Ford said that he was going to ban phones in classrooms. Where I go to school this had no impact. This lets kids continue to ignore classes through technology. Though not all students use their phones these ways some use them to benefit themselves. My friend Sasha uses his phone during class but uses it to take pictures of information and learn more on the topic so that he has a better understanding. I believe technology allows people to grow and become better but it is up to the student to take the stride.\r\n                        <br></br>                    <br></br>\r\n\r\n                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that technology in the future will be positive. During the past ten years we have made major discoveries and innovations in technology. My theory on the future of computers is that we will continue with the same things. Even though we have made all of these discoveries, they are all very similar. Today we pretty much all have smartphones, not flip phones and the same can be said about computers. Computers are either laptops or desktops, people seem to be moving towards laptops unless they are doing major tasks, in an office or gamers. I believe desktops will stay the same and only the parts will change, and that laptops will continue to get thin, better resolution and better specs while increasing the price too much. Maybe far into the future we will even have holographic laptops.\r\n                        <br></br><br></br>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nfunction Body() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div class=\"all\">\r\n            <div class=\"title\">\r\n                <div class=\"w3-container w3-center w3-animate-fading\">\r\n                    <h1 >Full Stack Developer</h1>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <About></About>\r\n            <br></br><br></br>\r\n            <Schools></Schools>\r\n            <MyPerspective></MyPerspective>\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Body;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport './style.css';\r\n\r\nexport default class Footer extends React.Component {\r\n    state = {\r\n        image: [\r\n\r\n            \"https://a.slack-edge.com/80588/img/plugins/github/service_512.png\",\r\n            //github\r\n\r\n            \"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/04/google-gmail-logo-100755954-large.jpg\"\r\n            //gmail\r\n        ],\r\n        link: [\r\n\r\n            //github\r\n            \"https://github.com/Master4020\",\r\n\r\n            //gmail\r\n            \"mailto:christienyenwalker@gmail.com\"\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <footer class=\"footer\">\r\n                <div>\r\n                    <nav>\r\n                        <ul>\r\n                            <a href={this.state.link[0]}><img src={this.state.image[0]} alt=\"img\"></img></a>\r\n                            <a href={this.state.link[1]}><img src={this.state.image[1]} alt=\"img\"></img></a>\r\n                        </ul>\r\n                    </nav>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </footer>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\nimport Header from './components/header.js';\r\nimport Body from './components/body.js';\r\nimport Footer from './components/footer.js';\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"App\">\r\n      <header className=\"App-header\">\r\n       {/* <Header></Header> */}\r\n      <Body></Body>\r\n       {/* <Footer></Footer> */}\r\n      </header>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App;\r\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\r\n// register() is not called by default.\r\n\r\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\r\n// it offline capabilities.
